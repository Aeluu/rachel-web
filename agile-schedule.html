        <h4>How I put together a sprint schedule</h4>
        <p>Every single one of these sections can be elaborated in much more detail, but this is mainly focused on how to schedule them in an agile setting.</p>
        <h5>Product Kick-offs</h5>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 6px; color: #0E2440;">WHEN? Whenever a big feature requires Product or Design feedback.</p>

        <p>During a Product Kickoff, it is important to address clearly what the problem is that produced the ‚Äúidea‚Äù or ‚Äúproject‚Äù, because it is often that the idea was a projected solution to a problem that Product can determine is viable or not. It is also imperative that roles are assigned so that expectations and tasks are met. Product Kick-offs are not the same as Technical Kick-offs. It should not be estimated within a development sprint. When a new idea or project is being presented, Product will Kick-off with the necessary stakeholders.</p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 6px">The stakeholders must include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Primary Stakeholder (usually the person behind the idea)</li>
          <li>Technical Stakeholder (A person that can best determine if an idea or project is technically feasible)</li>
          <li>Product Stakeholder (A person that can determine if an idea or project should be carried out for the benefit of the company, usually the product owner)</li> 
          <li>Product Designer (A person that needs the resources discussed in Product Kick-offs to execute an idea or project). Often the Product Manager holds these meetings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Design Grooming</h5>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 6px; color: #0E2440;">WHEN? Every second Wednesday. Cancelled if no new features need to be introduced.</p>

        <p>It is often expected that the designer has a design grooming session with developers during the design and product process. Design groomings allow the Designer to show Developers possible solutions to the executed problem, and gain insights. It is a valuable opportunity for a Developer to share their personal thoughts and ideas which can affect the overall outcome of the product. There should be discussion about solutions that save time, especially if time is imperative for a specific feature or project (usually this is the case). It should be reported that taking shortcuts to save time hurts the user experience. This is not the same as a Technical grooming or estimation.</p>

        <h5>Technical Grooming</h5>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 6px; color: #0E2440;">WHEN? Every second Friday before the next Sprint begins.</p>

        <p>Technical Groomings happen when the PM and Developers go through tickets/stories that have been added to the product backlog, and are being prepared for an upcoming sprint. During this phase, the PM and Developers clarify all the requirements of each ticket and address that everything they need is readily available. It is during this time where the PM will assign tickets to Developers so they can start to estimate them. If something is not clear or assets are missing, the Developer can reject it.</p>

        <h5>Estimations</h5>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 6px; color: #0E2440;">WHEN? Between Technical Grooming and Sprint Planning.</p>

        <p>After technical grooming, Developers will be assigned tickets that can be accepted during planning. It is the Developer‚Äôs responsibility to estimate a ticket before Planning. If a ticket involves an extended period of discovery and research for proper estimation, then a Discovery/Research ticket may be created to track effort. Estimation can happen anytime after Technical Grooming and Sprint Planning. If a ticket was not estimated before Planning, it will not be added to the sprint, it will be estimated during Planning.</p>

        <h5>Sprint Planning</h5>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 6px; color: #0E2440;">WHEN? Every first Tuesday Sprint Planning.</p>

        <p>During Sprint Planning, the IT team decides what stories to move into the new sprint. All stories that are moved into an active sprint must should be estimated and groomed beforehand. It is the Developer's responsibility to accept tasks that can be completed in one sprint to the best of their ability.</p>

        <h5>Retrospective</h5>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 6px; color: #0E2440;">WHEN? At the end of every sprint or at least once a month.</p>

        <p>Retrospectives are a great initiative to gather the finer issues that are dealt with in an agile environment. The product and development teams are often invited to participate, but keeping retros within teams yield better results.</p>

        <h5>Reviews / Demo Meetings</h5>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 6px; color: #0E2440;">WHEN? Every first Tuesday after Sprint Planning.</p>

        <p>This is the opportunity for Product to share what Development has worked on during the previous sprint. All team members are welcome to join and ask questions or address their concerns.</p>
