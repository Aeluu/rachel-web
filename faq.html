        <h4>Frequently asked questions</h4>
        <p style="color: #0E2440; font-weight: 600; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom:4px;">How much experience do you have?</p>
        <p>I have been working in product design for about 6 years, with the past 3 years focused on leading and running small teams. Additionally, I have 2 years of art direction and advertising experience, with a focus on branding and marketing campaigns.</p>
        <p style="color: #0E2440; font-weight: 600; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom:4px;">What kind of products have you worked on?</p>
        <p>I have worked with a variety of products, but my experience is mostly related to B2C products. I have worked on native iOS / Android applications, responsive web platforms, B2B SaaS applications and have even shipped features for the Apple Watch.</p> 
        <p style="color: #0E2440; font-weight: 600; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom:4px;">What is your strongest skill?</p>
        <p>I have excellent communication skills, in person, on paper or remotely. I communicate well internally within a company structure, and externally, to all users of any product.</p>
        <p style="color: #0E2440; font-weight: 600; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom:4px;">How big are the teams you lead?</p>
        <p>My experience is mostly related to working with small companies (companies with about 30-60 people), so I'm more accustomed to leading teams that range from about 4-10 people. I've worked in corporate settings before (with +100 employees) and I am familiar with their processes, but never had the opportunity to lead a team in those large-scale environments. However, I'm confident I can apply my current knowledge to those areas.</p>
        <p style="color: #0E2440; font-weight: 600; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom:4px;">How would you describe your product roadmap process?</p>
        <p>I create Product Roadmaps based on quarterly schedules that tend to be focused on OKRs and KPIs. I prefer to work with companies that are familiar with releasing and hitting goals in an agile environment. My processes work well with a lot of tech companies, but sometimes they can change depending on the team size or project expectation. <a href="agile-schedule.html">Here</a> is an article I wrote about how I lead agile teams, and <a href="execute-product.html">here</a> is an article on how I incorporate design thinking processes with product teams.</p>
        <p style="color: #0E2440; font-weight: 600; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom:4px;">What tools do you use?</p>
        <p>For <strong>product management:</strong> Jira, Confluence and Trello. I'm a huge fan of Coda for documentation.</p>
        <p>For <strong>product design:</strong> Sketch and Figma for design, InVision for fast prototyping, Principle and Framer for high-quality prototyping. I am familiar with Illustrator, Photoshop and Adobe XD, but I find other products far superior to Adobe, and would make teams switch if given the opportunity.</p>
        <p style="color: #0E2440; font-weight: 600; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom:4px;">What other skills do you bring to the table?</p>
        <p>I actually graduated with an Art Director degree in Advertising and worked with agencies for a few years. I am an excellent (English) copywriter, great at executing marketing campaigns, and have an exceptional skill at branding companies. I am also quite good at HTML / CSS and familiar with some Javascript.</p> 
        <p style="color: #0E2440; font-weight: 600; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom:4px;">Do you speak German?</p>
        <p>I've been working on a lot of German products for the past few years, but unfortunately my German speaking skills are not good enough for a German-speaking environment, sorry! I am very familiar with the German market however.</p> 
        <p style="color: #0E2440; font-weight: 600; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom:4px;">How do you feel about remote work?</p>
        <p>I have nothing against it! Considering the current COVID-19 scenario, I think it will be an opportunity for a lot of businesses in the near future. I have experience working and leading teams completely remotely. I personally prefer "hybrid" work environments, where half the work is on-site and the other half is off-site. You can ask me for further details regarding this!</p>
        <p style="color: #0E2440; font-weight: 600; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom:4px;">How do you feel about relocating?</p>
        <p>I am 100% open to relocating for the right opportunity! I've been in Berlin for the past 5 years and love it, but I'm very eager to design for other markets and other countries. I have lived and worked in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seoul and Berlin.</p>
