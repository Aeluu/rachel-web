        <h4>Frequently asked questions</h4>
        <p style="color: #0E2440; font-weight: 600; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom:4px;">How much experience do you have?</p>
        <p>I have been working in product for more than 6 years, with the past 3 years focused on leading and running small product teams. Additionally, I have 2 years of art direction and advertising experience, with a focus on branding and marketing campaigns.</p>
        <p style="color: #0E2440; font-weight: 600; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom:4px;">What kind of products have you worked on?</p>
        <p>I have worked with a variety of products, but my experience is mostly related to B2C products. Many of the platforms were related to fintech and the majority of my experience is in a tech and start-up environment. I have worked on native iOS / Android applications, responsive web platforms, B2B SaaS applications and have even shipped features for the Apple Watch.</p> 
        <p style="color: #0E2440; font-weight: 600; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom:4px;">What kind of features have you worked on?</p>
        <p>I am pretty familiar with payment structures, onboarding, and registration processes for native and web applications as that covers a big portion of what I actively worked on. Though, I believe all of these user experiences vary depending on the product. I'm really open to new challenges and solving other problems, and have a deep interest in working with deep-learning technology.</p> 
        <p style="color: #0E2440; font-weight: 600; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom:4px;">What are you good at?</p>
        <p>I have excellent communication skills, in person, on paper or remotely! I communicate well internally within a company structure, and externally, to all users of any product. Being able to communicate well was what led me into a product management role. I also love doing presentations!</p>
        <p style="color: #0E2440; font-weight: 600; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom:4px;">How big are the teams you lead?</p>
        <p>My experience is mostly related to working with small companies (companies with about 20-40 people), so I'm more accustomed to leading teams that range from about 4-10 people. I wish I could say that I have the experience to lead in big team environments, but I haven't had the opportunity yet. However, I'm confident I can apply my current knowledge to those areas and really interested to take that challenge.</p>
        <p style="color: #0E2440; font-weight: 600; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom:4px;">How would you describe your product roadmap process?</p>
        <p>I create Product Roadmaps based on quarterly schedules that tend to be focused on company OKRs and KPIs. I prefer to work with companies that are familiar with releasing and hitting goals in an agile and sprint environment. My processes work well with a lot of tech companies, but sometimes they can change depending on the team size or project expectation. <a href="agile-schedule.html">Here</a> is an article I wrote about how I lead agile teams, and <a href="execute-product.html">here</a> is an article on how I incorporate design thinking processes with product teams.</p>
        <p style="color: #0E2440; font-weight: 600; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom:4px;">What tools are you familiar with?</p>
        <p>For <strong>product management:</strong> I used Jira and Confluence for the majority of my career but flexible with a company's preferences.</p>
        <p>For <strong>product design:</strong> Sketch and Figma for design, InVision for fast prototyping, Principle and Framer for high-quality prototyping. I am also familiar with Adobe suite applications such as Illustrator and XD.</p>
        <p style="color: #0E2440; font-weight: 600; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom:4px;">How do you feel about remote work?</p>
        <p>I love working remotely! I sometimes miss being in the office but the freedom that remote work has offered is much more valuable to me personally. I've been working remotely for the past year, and my company was also started on a complete remote basis! So I'm very familiar with this type of environment.</p>
        <p style="color: #0E2440; font-weight: 600; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom:4px;">What other skills do you bring to the table?</p>
        <p>I've lived and worked in three continents (Asia, North America, Europe), so I feel like I have a very wide range of demographic knowledge. I also graduated with an Art Director degree in Advertising and worked with agencies for a few years. I am an excellent (English) copywriter, love contributing to marketing campaigns, and still maintain a skill in branding! I can do some HTML / CSS and familiar with some Javascript (for example, I made my entire website from scratch üò∏)</p> 
        <p style="color: #0E2440; font-weight: 600; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom:4px;">Do you speak German?</p>
        <p>I've been working on a lot of German products for the past few years, but unfortunately my German speaking skills are not good enough for a German-speaking environment, sorry! I am very familiar with the German market however.</p> 
        <p style="color: #0E2440; font-weight: 600; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom:4px;">How do you feel about relocating?</p>
        <p>I'm always open to relocating for the right opportunity, but I prefer 100% remote work. I travel a lot between North America, Europe and Asia so flexibility is very important to me!</p>
