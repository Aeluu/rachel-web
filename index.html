    		<p>I have worked with small teams for a few years now, and adding to that "ebb and flow" within a team has always improved the value of any product release. Here are some articles I put together that detail how I approach agile processes in a product environment.</p>

      <div class="one-third column">
        <h6><a href="">How I document product features and executions</a></h6>
        <p>This is a template I made for documenting features. Its a great starting-point for any project, but I find it goes through a lot of revisions if things are not well-defined in the beginning.</p>

    		<h6>The good, the Bad, the Ugly</h6>
    		<p>Despite the constant "tech-hype", working for a startup is not always awesome. I have experienced first-hand a wide variety of constraints; let's just say that makes me a highly adaptable individual when introduced to a new environment.</p>

    		<h4 style="text-align: center;">Frequently asked questions</h4>
    		<p style="text-align: center;">Why wait for an interview to get to know me?</p>
    		<p style="color: #0E2440; font-weight: 600; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom:4px;">What is your design process?</p>
        	<p>I‚Äôm a huge fan of the design-thinking process but even applying it the "Google" way doesn't work for every company; it is definitely dependent on the team's KPIs, team size and team capacity. I've been able to implement it into my own process, which is adapted to the teams I've worked with along the way. I go into much more detail in my article, <a href="#">How to execute a product, design or feature (on a budget).</a></p>
        	<p style="color: #0E2440; font-weight: 600; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom:4px;">How much experience do you have?</p>
        	<p>I‚Äôve been in the design industry for a total of 7 years now. I have been strictly working in product design for the past 5 years. For the past 2-3 years, I have been working in a lot of hybrid roles that required product management as well. Before that I was an art director in advertising for about 2 years <i>(not including the 4 years of Advertising I studied in San Francisco)</i>. The skills of an art director translated well for me when I transitioned into product roles. </p>
        	<p style="color: #0E2440; font-weight: 600; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom:4px;">What is your strongest skill?</p>
        	<p>All design aside, my strongest skill (<i>and the skill I‚Äôm still tirelessly working to improve on</i>) is <strong>communication</strong>. If I consider all the companies I have worked for, internal and external communication between all parties will make-it or break-it for a product. Being able to communicate properly with the people I work with has always helped in the execution process.</p>
