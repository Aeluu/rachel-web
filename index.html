    		<h4 style="text-align: center;">Frequently asked questions</h4>
    		<p style="text-align: center;">Why wait for an interview to get to know me?</p>
    		<p style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom:4px;">What is your design process?</p>
    		<p>Iâ€™m a huge fan of the design-thinking process but thereâ€™s no one process for every company; it often depends on the team size and capacity. I go into much more detail here: How to execute a product, design or feature (on a budget).</p>
    		<p style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom:4px;">How much experience do you have?</p>
    		<p>Iâ€™ve been in the design industry for a total of 7 years now. I have been strictly working in product design for the past 5 years, and before that I was an art director in advertising for about 2 years. The transition was easier than other fields because creative initiatives for advertising required the same type of demographic research as needed for product, and a lot of skills I had overlapped nicely.</p>
    		<p style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom:4px;">What is your strongest skill?</p>
    		<p>All design aside, my strongest skill (and the skill Iâ€™m still tirelessly improving on to this day) is communication. If I consider all the companies I have worked for, internal and external communication between all parties will make-it or break-it for a product. Being able to communicate properly with the people I work with has always helped in the execution process.</p>
    		<p style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom:4px;">How do you feel about relocating?</p>
    		<p>I would definitely prefer to stay in Berlin. However, I am open to relocate for the absolute perfect opportunity in only these cities: Seoul, London and San Francisco.</p>
