        <p class="authortext">Answered by Rachel</p>
        <h5 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">What is your design process?</h5>
        <p>I try to implement a design-thinking process as often as possible. If you would like more details, check out <a href="executeproduct.html">my article</a>. I go into detail about how I try to execute and deliver things for a project or feature.</p>
        <h5 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">How much experience do you have?</h5>
        <p>I've been working in the design industry for a total of 6 years now. I have 4 years of experience with product design and 2 years of experience with advertising design. I graduated with an art direction degree in 2014, but I have been working full-time since 2012 to pay those American college bills.</p>
        <h5 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">What is your strongest skill?</h5>
        <p>To be honest, I don't think I have one very strong skill in design. I think I am capable of many things, but not good enough to say I'm an expert at something specific. So, I'd say my strongest skill is communication. Being able to communicate with the people I work with helps deliver a stronger product. It also helps during user-interviews!</p>
        <h5 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">What is a skill that could use some improvement?</h5>
        <p>EVERYTHING! I've gotten to a weird point in my career where I feel like the more information I absorb, the less I know. Aside from that, design seems to change so rapidly and I'm constantly struggling to adapt to new trends. If I had to only pick one thing, then I want to improve on my ux-researching skills. Gathering the right data has always been very tricky.</p>
        <h5 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">How do you work with other designers, developers and product managers?</h5>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Developers: A lot of communication...as long as I don't interrupt their workflow. I try to have design reviews as often as I can, so I can gather their feedback (which I find really valuable) and we can match expectations when I deliver something. For example, this often helps to alleviate some frustrations when they have to accept a design ticket. </li>
            <li>PMs: I think its important that we stay on the same page, and have enough touchpoints to make sure we're both catering to the user. I'm used to working with small teams, so it was not uncommon for me to work alongside a PM and do some of their tasks such as writing tickets, running sync-meetings and coordinating with other departments.</li>
            <li>Designers: If there is more than one designer on the team, it really helps that we're all invovled as often as possible, from every stage of a design process. More ideas, more suggestions and more people pointing out problems usually result in a better product in the end.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h5 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">What was your most favorite project to work on?</h5>
        <p>Groupup, of course! Groupup was finally an opportunity for me to have some creative control and put my skills to the test. This is such an amazing opportunity for me to build on myself.</p>
        <h5 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">What kind of tools do you use for product design?</h5>
        <p>The products I use nearly everyday are Sketch, Zeplin and sometimes sublime. I tinker around in After Effects for some cool animations, but I can't say I'm an expert at that. I'm familiar with Photoshop and Illustrator as well, but I've abandoned those programs for now. For lo-fidelity prototyping or brainstorming, I use good ol' pen and paper. For hi-fidelity prototypes, I use Principle and Invision. I'm currently learning Framer!</p>
        <h5 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">How do you find the time to work on personal projects while working full-time?</h5>
        <p>You know how some people have hobbies outside of work, such as going to the gym or taking a nice hike? Instead of doing that, I go straight home to my cats and work on my other projects till the sun goes down. (I should probably go out more though)</p>
        <h5 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Do you do freelance work?</h5>
        <p>At the moment I do not have any time to do freelance work.</p>
        <h5 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Can I hire you as an illustrator?</h5>
        <p>Illustration is only a hobby of mine, but I'm glad you think its worth being paid for! I wouldn't even know what to charge you.</p>
        <h6 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Do you have more questions for me?</h6>
        <p>Just send me an <a href="#contactme">email</a>, and I'll get back to you as soon as possible.</p>
