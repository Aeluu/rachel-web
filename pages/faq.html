        <p class="authortext">Answered by Rachel</p>
        <h5 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">What is your design process?</h5>
        <p>I try to implement a design-thinking process as often as possible. If you would like more details, check out <a href="executeproduct.html">my article</a>. I go into detail about how I execute and deliver things for a project or feature.</p>
        <h5 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">What is your strongest skill?</h5>
        <p>I don't think one skill works well on its own, but my user-interface designing is pretty kickass! I also think I'm very good at prototpying and user testing.</p>
        <h5 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">What is a skill that could use some improvement?</h5>
        <p>User research has always been kind of struggle for me, mainly because reliable resources are hard to come by. Producing live data is especially difficult because there are so many factors that are in play that can effect the end result.</p>
        <h5 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">How do you work with other designers, developers and product managers?</h5>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Developers: From experience, I found that developers always gave me some really interesting insight that users or people in product tend to overlook. For this reason, I try to set up a design estimation during the product phase and get feedback from them.</li>
            <li>PMs: I write detailed stories for the PM so they can fully understand the context of my designs, and make it easier to create tasks for developers. I also like to be involved in estimations, sprint planning and reviews. I even run sprints myself depending on which projects we have to carry out.</li>
            <li>Designers: I love having more than one designer on the team because you can bounce ideas back and forth and you can do a lot of validation in shorter amounts of time. I think its important that all designers are involved in every step of a product's execution, even if they are a junior.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h5 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">What was your most favorite project to work on?</h5>
        <p>Groupup, of course! Groupup was finally an opportunity for me to have complete creative control and put my skills to the test.</p>
        <h5 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">What kind of tools do you use for product design?</h5>
        <p>The products I use nearly everyday are Sketch, Zeplin and Sublime. For lo-fidelity prototyping or brainstorming, I use pen and paper. For hi-fidelity prototypes, I use Principle or Framer.</p>
        <h5 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">How do you find the time to work on personal projects while working full-time?</h5>
        <p>You know how some people have hobbies outside of work, such as going to the gym or taking a nice hike? Instead of doing that, I go straight home to my cats and work on my other projects till the sun goes down.</p>
        <h5 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Do you do freelance work?</h5>
        <p>At the moment I do not have any time to do freelance work.</p>
        <h5 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Can I hire you as an illustrator?</h5>
        <p>Illustration is only a hobby of mine, but I'm glad you think its worth being paid for! I wouldn't even know what to charge you.</p>
        <h6 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Do you have more questions for me?</h6>
        <p>Just send me an <a href="#contactme">email</a>, and I'll get back to you as soon as possible.</p>
