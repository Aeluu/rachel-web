        <p class="authortext">Answered by Rachel</p>
        <h5 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">What is your design process?</h5>
        <p>I try to implement a design-thinking process when I carry out a feature or a request. If you would like more details, check out <a href="">my article</a>. I go into detail about how I execute and deliver things for a project or feature.</p>
        <h5 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">What is your strongest skill?</h5>
        <p>I don't think one skill works well on its own, but my user-interface designing is pretty kickass. I also think I'm very good at prototpying and user testing.</p>
        <h5 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">What is a skill that could use some improvement?</h5>
        <p>User research has always been kind of struggle for me, mainly because reliable resources are hard to come by. Even producing live data becomes difficult because there are so many factors that are in play that can effect the end result.</p>
        <h5 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">How do you work with other designers, developers and product managers?</h5>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Developers: I like to work closely with developers, as they tend to understand what is technically possible within certain constraints. I often have design estimations with developers because they give the most out-of-the-box insight, or tend to point things out that only a developer can see.</li>
            <li>PMs: I often act as a PM if I'm not busy with product design, and assist them directly wherever I can. I write detailed stories, help in estimations and sprint planning and provide most of the content that developers need to get their work done.</li>
            <li>Designers: Having more than one designer on the product team is really helpful because you can bounce ideas back and forth and really excel the progress of a specific task. I try to involve all designers in every step and process and gather insight and demonstrating flexibility.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h5 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">What was your most favorite project to work on?</h5>
        <p>Groupup, of course! Groupup was finally an opportunity for me to have complete creative control and put my skills to the test.</p>
        <h5 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">What kind of tools do you use for product design?</h5>
        <p>I use Sketch most of the time, and Zeplin to pass on specifications to developers. For hi-fidelity prototypes, I use Principle or Framer. If I'm doing a web project, I usually make prototypes directly using HTML/CSS/JS.</p>
        <h5 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">How do you find time to work on so many projects at once?</h5>
        <p>You know how some people have a life outside of work, and have other fun hobbies such as hiking? I don't have any of those hobbies because I enjoy working on side projects during my free-time.</p>
        <h5 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Do you do freelance work?</h5>
        <p>At the moment I do not have any time to do freelance work.</p>
        <h5 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Can I hire you as an illustrator?</h5>
        <p>Sorry! Illustration is only a hobby of mine. I'm not confident enough to have my illustrations represent a product. If you're a designer, you probably will understand what its like to see things you have drawn 6 months ago. It is always an embarrassment!</p>
        <h6 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Do you have more questions for me?</h6>
        <p>Just send me an email, and I'll get back to you as soon as possible.</p>
