        <h2>How I put together a sprint schedule</h2>
        <p>At one of my previous jobs we were left without a product mananger for 8 months. The development and product team was very small: we had 2 product people and 6 developers. I felt that I had the right resources to provide the IT team with what they needed, and decided to step in and help structure a team that was falling apart. It was during this time that I took on the role as a designer and an interim PM. As a designer, this was also a good opportunity for me to develop a better relationship with our developers. Below you can find what I presented and shared with our IT and Product team to help create a more cohesive sync. I don't reccommend this for everyone; I think its important you create a process that works for your team.  </p>

        <h4>Product Kick-offs</h4>
        <p>During a Product Kickoff, it is important to address clearly what the problem is that produced the “idea” or “project”, because it is often that the idea was a projected solution to a problem that Product can determine is viable or not. It is also imperative that roles are assigned so that expectations and tasks are met. <strong>Product Kick-offs are not the same as Technical Kick-offs.</strong> It should not be estimated within a development sprint. When a new idea or project is being presented, Product will Kick-off with the necessary stakeholders. </p>

        <p><strong>The stakeholders must include: </strong></br>
        <strong>Primary Stakeholder</strong> (usually the person behind the idea)</br>
        <strong>Technical Stakeholder</strong> (A person that can best determine if an idea or project is technically feasible)</br>
        <strong>Product Stakeholder</strong> (A person that can determine if an idea or project should be carried out for the benefit of the company) </br>
        <strong>Product Designer</strong> (A person that needs the resources discussed in Product Kick-offs to execute an idea or project). Often the Product Designer holds these meetings. </br></p>

        <h4>Technical Kick-offs</h4>
        <p>A technical kick-off will be presented when an idea (that has gone through Product Kick-offs) has been approved, and the product team is actively working on it. This Kick-off purpose is to help the IT team understand what’s coming (what they will work on) and why the decision was made (big picture). The point is to align expectations so Developers are mentally ready for the next grooming. </p>

        <h4>Design grooming and estimation</h4>
        <p>It is often expected that the designer has a design grooming session with developers during the design and product process. Design groomings allow the Designer to show Developers possible solutions to the executed problem, and gain insights. It is a valuable opportunity for a Developer to share their personal thoughts and ideas which can affect the overall outcome of the product. There should be discussion about solutions that save time, if time is imperative for a specific feature or project (usually this is the case). It should be reported that taking shortcuts to save time hurts the user experience. <strong>This is not the same as a Technical grooming or estimation.</strong></p>

        <h4>Technical grooming</h4>
        <p>Tickets have already been added to the product backlog, but are also up for discussion and changes. This all happens before PM starts breaking down stories. It is during this time where PM can assign tickets to Developers and they can start to estimate it. </p>

        <h4>Estimations</h4>
        <p>After technical grooming, Developers will be assigned tickets that can be accepted during planning. It is the Developer’s responsibility to estimate a ticket before planning. If a ticket involves discover and research for proper estimation, this should also be done during this time as well. Estimation can happen between Grooming and Sprint Planning. If a ticket was not estimated before planning, it will not be added to the sprint. Bugs are not estimated.</p>

        <h4>Sprint Planning</h4>
        <p>During Sprint Planning, the IT team decides what stories to accept into the new sprint. All stories that are moved into an active sprint must have been estimated and groomed beforehand. Because estimation has been determined by the Developer who accepts the tasks, it is the Developer's responsibility to accept tasks that can be completed in one sprint to the best of their ability. </p>

        <h4>Reviews</h4>
        <p>This is the opportunity for everyone to share what they have worked on and what they have achieved with everyone else.</p>
