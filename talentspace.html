        <p>Talentspace is a virtual and hybrid event platform catered to universities, employers and event organisers. Currently being used worldwide by well known companies such as Google, Amazon and Porsche and prestigious universities like Stanford and Brown.</p>
        <p>Talentspace quickly adapted to the Covid-19 environment and focused on maintaining a professional and reliable space online for all types of event organisers.</p>

    <h5 style="font-weight: 600; margin-top: 4%;">Primary Role: <div style="font-weight: 400; display: inline;">Design Management and UI design</div></h5>
    <p>I joined Talentspace and was promoted to Design Lead in a month. I currently run a team with two other designers. Talentspace is a very fast-paced company that did not have a very manageable design system or process. This was quickly addressed with the Senior PM and required upper-management to understand the value of slowing down and validating designs before going into production.</p>
    <h5 style="margin-top: 4%;">Lobby Re-design</h5>
    <p>The first project I worked on was re-designing the lobby version of the platform. The changes I implemented made the lobby more engaging, connected, and alive. Instead of showing plain text and static content, we showed real people engaging in real-time with different event formats.</p>

    <h5 style="margin-top: 4%;">Video Re-design</h5>
    <p>Right after the lobby changes were implemented, we started to update and clean up the UI and introduced the design system components with the developers. We also decided it was a good time to update the user interface and experience of the video sessions (where most of our users spent their time).</p>
    <p>I also added an 'Activity Feed' bar, that gave people real-time updates that was posted by companies attending the virtual event. All of these additions brought the event alive in an era where professional interactions have shifted to an online environment.</p>
    <img class="desktopshot" src="img/talentspace/talentspace2.png">
    <p style="margin-top: 4%;">With this updated design we addressed the overall UI and also several UX issues, including adding new features that became a standard post-covid. One such feature we recently worked on was adding "Breakout Rooms" functionality.</p>
